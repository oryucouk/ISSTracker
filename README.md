# ISSTracker
Track the ISS station in the sky using API calls
API calls to ISS tracker allowing polling of ISS position, folks onboard as well as when it can be seen in the skies.
This is currently a work-in-progress as I finish adding all relevant features and then build a user interface system around it,
perhaps web-based. For now, this acts as an information stub. The ISSTracker.go file still works and returns results for locations 
in East London.
